## Greek Islands 🇬🇷

> This post is a continuation of the "Birkinbine EU Trip". The first post can be found here: [London and the Cotswolds](/posts/london-and-the-cotswolds)

The second half of the "Birkinbine EU Trip" took place in the Greek Islands. My mom had done a lot of research before the trip and really wanted to visit the Greek Islands for their great scenery and to escape the very snowy winter they had in Colorado. Our flight to Santorini was scheduled for the evening and if all went smoothly we would get into Santorini around midnight. However, we ran into some... difficulties...

More than halfway through our flight from London to Santorini, we felt the plane make a sharp turn in what felt like the other direction. We were sitting in the exit row and started to look around. We noticed that our windows were nearly covered in ice. Shortly after our turn-around, the pilot announced that we would be landing in Venice, Italy because their was a problem with the plane's de-icing system. The plane instantly became quite disgruntled. We had to stay in Venice overnight, and our flight was re-scheduled for late afternoon the next day. It was quite the ordeal but also kind of neat as my parents got to say then made a "surprise visit" to Venice!

We got into Santorini around dinner time and had an amazing dinner on-top of a large hill near our AirBnb. We went back to our place after dinner and played some card games before heading off to bed.

We left early the next morning to catch a ferry to Naxos!

### Naxos

Naxos was one of our favorite islands. It is considered to be one of the more "authentic" Greek Islands. It is also the largest island in the Cyclades island group. Naxos is considered to be quite cheap compare to the other islands and also gets less tourists compared to Santorini. We had a lot of amazing Greek food, checked out a beach, and did plenty of exploring through the many winding streets of Naxos.
