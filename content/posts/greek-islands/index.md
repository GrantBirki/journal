## Greek Islands 🇬🇷

> This post is a continuation of the "Birkinbine EU Trip". The first post can be found here: [London and the Cotswolds](/posts/london-and-the-cotswolds)

The second half of the "Birkinbine EU Trip" took place in the Greek Islands. My mom had done a lot of research before the trip and really wanted to visit the Greek Islands for their great scenery and to escape the very snowy winter they had in Colorado. Our flight to Santorini was scheduled for the evening and if all went smoothly we would get into Santorini around midnight. However, we ran into some... difficulties...

More than halfway through our flight from London to Santorini, we felt the plane make a sharp turn in what felt like the other direction. We were sitting in the exit row and started to look around. We noticed that our windows were nearly covered in ice. Shortly after our turn-around, the pilot announced that we would be landing in Venice, Italy because their was a problem with the plane's de-icing system. The plane instantly became quite disgruntled. We had to stay in Venice overnight, and our flight was re-scheduled for late afternoon the next day. It was quite the ordeal but also kind of neat as my parents got to say then made a "surprise visit" to Venice!

We got into Santorini around dinner time and had an amazing dinner on-top of a large hill near our Airbnb. We went back to our place after dinner and played some card games before heading off to bed.

We left early the next morning to catch a ferry to Naxos!

### Naxos

Naxos was one of our favorite islands. It is considered to be one of the more "authentic" Greek Islands. It is also the largest island in the Cyclades island group. Naxos is considered to be quite cheap compare to the other islands and also gets less tourists compared to Santorini. We had a lot of amazing Greek food, checked out a beach, and did plenty of exploring through the many winding streets of Naxos.

We hiked up to the Temple of Apollo to catch the sunset and take some pictures.

### Paros

Our next stop in the Greek Islands was Paros. My mom had done some searching on YouTube (go Betsy!) and found a super nice boutique hotel for us to stay at. After this stay, we pretty much determined that boutique hotels are our new favorite was to travel. The hotel was called "Hotel Senia" and it was amazing. It came with a wonder breakfast each day, tasty coffee, and a great pool with a few of the sea.

Paros had some really great beaches so we spent a lot of time laying in the sun and soaking up some rays. We had a rental car for two of our days there so we did a lot of driving around the island and checking out the different beaches and a few different towns.

We did a lot of exploring beyond just the beach of Paros as well! Here are some pictures from our adventures.

Our boutique hotel had a really stunning view during the day, but when we returned at night, it was equally amazing. The pool in the main area was all lit up with star lights and all the neighboring towns on different parts of the island were all lit up as well. 🌟

Our last stop in the Greek Islands was to head back to Santorini for a few days before heading back to London. We took another ferry back to Santorini to get there. The ferries were **huge** and were almost like a small-scale cruise ship. They had many different restaurants, cafes, bars, and tons of in/outdoor seating.

### Santorini

Our return to Santorini was our last stop in the Greek Islands. We started and ended our trip here since the airport was the easiest to fly in and out of. This time around, we had a whole house to ourselves just north of Thera. The house we had was wonderful and it might have been in a newly developed area because we did not have any direct neighbors next to us so it was a lot quieter than some of the other places we walked by which was quite nice.

In Santorini, we spent a lot of our time exploring the streets up and down the caldera and eating plenty of delicious food!

On our last "full" day in Santorini we decided to do the hike to Oia. The trail was the same one seen in the picture above (right in front of our Airbnb) and it would take us all the way to Oia along the edge of the caldera. The hike had some really stunning views and we were glad to be in Greece in May as it wasn't too hot yet to make the hike unbearable.

Joe set off on the hike a bit before us to go at his own pace and figured we would catch up to him along the way. It turns out, he was actually quite speedy and we didn't even manage to catch up with him until he stopped at a church on-top of a hill to soak in the views

The church was our last stopping point before we descended into Oia along the trail. Oia was a beautiful town with tons of shops, restaurants, bakeries, and winding streets. It was quite busy though for this reason so we had to carefully navigate our way though the sea of people. Here are some pics we captured while in Oia!

We took a taxi back to our Airbnb to catch the sunset from the roof of our house and get some pictures as well before going out to dinner.

For our last night in the Greek Islands, we got a table at a near-by restaurant that looked over the caldera. The sun was just setting as we got our table on the roof. Shortly after the sun set, clouds rolled in and we were absorbed into the fog which was quite scenic in its own sense. Our meal was fantastic and it was a great way to celebrate our last night and reward our very hungry bellies after a long hike in the sun.

We truly enjoyed every second we had in the Greek Islands together and it is a trip my family will certainly always remember. On our last day in Santorini, my dad said to me "*I think these islands are the most beautiful place in the world*" and that statement alone made the whole trip worth it ❤️. I am so grateful that my family got to experience this trip and see a new part of the world together!
