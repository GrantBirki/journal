## Colombia 🇨🇴

Only about 6 months ago, Leah and I had returned from our [Europe](/posts/europe) backpacking trip. Since then, we had moved to Seattle. Leah had started nanning and had saved up a good chunk of money for another trip. I had started working at a small bagel cafe called [Eltana](https://eltana.com) and had just enough money to do a budget backpacking trip somewhere. Leah and I started looking for cheap international flights and had our eyes set on South America. Neither of us had ever been to South America before and decided it would be a great new place for us to explore together.

We managed to secure some super cheap flights from Seattle to Bogota, Colombia and so our adventure begins!

### Bogota

After a couple of cramped flights and a rough overnight layover in Mexico city, our plane descended into Bogota. Bogota is the capitol of Colombia and is nestled up against a mountain range. It was a foggy and cool day in Bogota which was delightful as the majority of Colombia can get quite hot, even in February.

We were rocking the same huge backpacks that we trekked all over Europe in, so our first order of business was to drop them off at our Airbnb. After dropping off our gear, we set off into the heart of Bogota to check it out and keep our legs moving after sitting for a long time on our flights.

Our first order of business was to try some authentic Colombian **coffee** ☕. Coffee will certainly be a theme throughout this post as Colombia has some of the best (and freshest) coffee in the world.

After getting some coffee, we joined a walking tour that showed us a lot of different street art in downtown Bogota. We also tried some local TODO. Many of the locals drink TODO and especially farmers as it is considered "energy breakfast in a cup".

We continued down even more streets that were just packed with street art and vibrant colors. So far, we were beginning to learn that Colombia is an incredibly colorful place in its architecture, people, and foods.

Our next stop was to explore some museums in downtown Bogota. The first one we stopped by was a free art gallery with some pretty unique style of paintings... Leah and I thought they were pretty goofy.

![IMG_2447_LR](IMG_2447_LR.jpg)
![IMG_2448_LR](IMG_2448_LR.jpg)

After the art gallery, we walked around aimlessly to find food, and see what Bogota was like on the streets.

We checked out the Museum of Gold which contained a ton of artifacts all crafted with or ordained in gold. It was super interesting and it was clear that the "El Dorado" legend was geographically fitting here.

![IMG_2508_LR](IMG_2508_LR.jpg)

We made yet another stop for coffee... This time, a brewing method that looked like *science*.

We hit one more museum that was known as the "emerald" or "mining" museum. It was dedicated to the mining of emeralds around Colombia and we both quite enjoyed it. The best part was the views from the top floor we got during sunset!

On our last day, we took a funicular up the mountain range that rests against Bogota. The view from the top were incredible. There were tons of flowers and windings streets at the top between old buildings and churches.

### Medellin

We hopped on a bus and left Bogota to Medellin. While waiting for the bus, we were told an interesting bit of detail from other folks waiting for the same bus. Now, you should probably "fact-check" this information but this is what we were told...

- Me: "Wow the busses are so cheap here! Just a few dollars to go all the way to Bogota to Medellin!"
- Stranger: "Yes, that is because the busses are all operated by drug cartels and the government turns a blind eye because it provides affordable public transportation."
- Me: 😮

Now it should be noted that both my parents and Leah's parents were a bit concerned when we told them we were going to Colombia. Not too long ago (80s / 90s) Colombia was largely considered the "most dangerous place in the world" due to rampant violence from drug cartels and kidnappings. However, we read that it has since improved a lot in recent years and is very welcoming to travelers. Thankfully, we felt very safe so far on our trip so we hopped on the bus with smiles. Who knows if our bus was owned by drug cartels or not, but all the other passengers were welcoming and kind. We didn't check under our seats though as a precaution 🙈.

While on our bus ride, Leah had found a small travel blog that suggested an experience I will truly never forget... paragliding! It was run by a local man named Marlon and he was extremely friendly. He picked us up right at our hostel in his van named "La Cheque". We learned that he has driven La Cheque all over South America and its his prized possession. Marlon drove us up a bunch of winding roads to a mountain top that overlooked all of Medellin. Without any wavers or safety talks, Leah and I were strapped into the paragliders with Marlon and his friend.

![IMG_2776_LR](IMG_2776_LR.jpg)

> Up in the air with all the other gliders

Our gliding tour was supposed to be about 30 minutes long in the air for each of us. However, after the last photo seen above, Marlon said that we needed to get higher. How they do this in their gliders was by doing a "corkscrew spin" to gain lift. I lasted about 3 minutes in this manoeuver before I felt violently ill. I said "Marlon, I think I might be sick", and then promptly barfed all over myself, Marlon's pants, and the many cows down below us.

Marlon went down to land and I ripped out of the harness and flopped down into the grass while everything was still spinning. I felt super bad that I blasted Marlon with my stomach contents and he felt really bad that I felt so ill. Leah landed shortly after and Marlon said he would take us to his favorite mountain coffee shop near by to cheer us up.

It turns out the coffee shop was actually a coffee farm and we got to drink delicious coffee while looking out over the very trees it was recently harvested from!

Later that day, we decided to checkout the gondola in the hills of Medellin. What is really interesting about this gondola, is that it is not for tourists to "soak in the scenic views" or to visit a great mountain top. Instead, it is a form of public transportation. It is relatively new and has been seen globally as quite innovative. The goal was to help people in lower income communities get into town better since they are located in the hills where it is not very walkable (especially for older residents). People use the gondola to get to work, go to doctors appointments, and bring home groceries. In Medellin, we also learned that the metro is source of great pride for its citizens. The keep it extremely clean and are quite proud of it as not too long ago it wasn't all that safe to take public transportation in the city.

We really enjoyed all the flora of Medellin (The City of Eternal Spring) so we strolled and checked out a lot more neighborhoods while we were there.

### Guatape

Our next stop on our journey in Colombia was Guatape. Guatape is a small area a few hours outside of Medellin and known for its extremely unique rock and water formations (you'll see pics below). We took the bus from Medellin to Guatape and this one was certainly a little more "rough around the edges". The thing that was unique about this bus is that it *did not stop* for its passengers. There was a guy who hung out the door of the bus looking for passengers. People would wave at him and the bus would simply *slow down a bit* as he pulled people onboard while driving past them. While this bus might have been a bit more sketchy, it would feel like luxury compared to one we would ride on later.

We got into Guatape in the afternoon and dropped our bags off at our eco-hostel before exploring the streets of the town and grabbing some food.

> A motorcycle parked in-front of a small pizza place. We would later go here for dinner and meet another man from Seattle who has been living in Guatape and working remotely

After food, we walked into the center of the town which was just packed with all sorts of vibrant colors and people!

We strolled the streets a bit more, got some dinner, and then headed back to our eco-hostel for the night. It was a wonderful place to stay and it overlooked a small coffee farm.

Our next day in Guatape, we set off early to climb TODO which is a huge "egg shaped" rock which has stellar views in all directions. You have to ascend a crisscross pattern of stairs all the way to the top and it is quite tiring.

We walked back through the town and out the other side to get to our eco-hostel. It was a long and hot day in the sun so we went back to hangout in some hammocks for a bit.

> Arriving at the eco-hostel

After hanging out for a bit we remembered that we didn't have any more bottles of water and I felt a bit iffy about the tap water at the eco-hostel. It was already dark and around 10pm but I figured we would need water before going to bed. The nearest shop with water was only about a 10 minute walk away so we figured *it would be fine*. We put on our shoes and began to stroll back down the path into town. About 2 minutes into our walk the sky begin to rapidly erupt with lightning. It was really beautiful but a bit concerning given it came out of absolutely no where. We got into the shop and bought a few bottles of water. As soon as we headed out of the shop I felt what may have been the largest drop of water land on me in my life. We both looked up to a sky of pure lightning and saw massive drops of rain coming down towards us. Leah yelled "RUN!" and we both started sprinting back down the path. Each raindrop was like getting swatted with a roll of newspaper and within seconds we were drenched. It was seriously the most intense rain I have ever been in. It was like the rainstorm in the first Jurassic park movie when they are trying to escape the island.

We completely gave up on trying to be dry and jogged back to our hostel laughing and yelling in the rain while completely soaked.

We ran out of water and went out to get some... and boy did we get some.

Our last day in Guatape we strolled through the town once more to checkout a few more side streets and get some tasty coffee before heading towards our next destination, Cartagena!
