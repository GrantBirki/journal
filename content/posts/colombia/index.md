## Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´

Only about 6 months ago, Leah and I had returned from our [Europe](/posts/europe) backpacking trip. Since then, we had moved to Seattle. Leah had started nanning and had saved up a good chunk of money for another trip. I had started working at a small bagel cafe called [Eltana](https://eltana.com) and had just enough money to do a budget backpacking trip somewhere. Leah and I started looking for cheap international flights and had our eyes set on South America. Neither of us had ever been to South America before and decided it would be a great new place for us to explore together.

We managed to secure some super cheap flights from Seattle to Bogota, Colombia and so our adventure begins!

### Bogota

After a couple of cramped flights and a rough overnight layover in Mexico city, our plane descended into Bogota. Bogota is the capitol of Colombia and is nestled up against a mountain range. It was a foggy and cool day in Bogota which was delightful as the majority of Colombia can get quite hot, even in February.

We were rocking the same huge backpacks that we trekked all over Europe in, so our first order of business was to drop them off at our Airbnb. After dropping off our gear, we set off into the heart of Bogota to check it out and keep our legs moving after sitting for a long time on our flights.

Our first order of business was to try some authentic Colombian **coffee** â˜•. Coffee will certainly be a theme throughout this post as Colombia has some of the best (and freshest) coffee in the world.

After getting some coffee, we joined a walking tour that showed us a lot of different street art in downtown Bogota. We also tried some local TODO. Many of the locals drink TODO and especially farmers as it is considered "energy breakfast in a cup".

We continued down even more streets that were just packed with street art and vibrant colors. So far, we were beginning to learn that Colombia is an incredibly colorful place in its architecture, people, and foods.

Our next stop was to explore some museums in downtown Bogota. The first one we stopped by was a free art gallery with some pretty unique style of paintings... Leah and I thought they were pretty goofy.

After the art gallery, we walked around aimlessly to find food, and see what Bogota was like on the streets.

We checked out the Museum of Gold which contained a ton of artifacts all crafted with or ordained in gold. It was super interesting and it was clear that the "El Dorado" legend was geographically fitting here.

We made yet another stop for coffee... This time, a brewing method that looked like *science*.

We hit one more museum that was known as the "emerald" or "mining" museum. It was dedicated to the mining of emeralds around Colombia and we both quite enjoyed it. The best part was the views from the top floor we got during sunset!

On our last day, we took a funicular up the mountain range that rests against Bogota. The view from the top were incredible. There were tons of flowers and windings streets at the top between old buildings and churches.
