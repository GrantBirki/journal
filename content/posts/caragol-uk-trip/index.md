## Caragol UK Trip 🇬🇧

While Leah and I were in the UK, Leah's family came over to visit us and do a whole bunch of traveling all over the UK!

### Dublin, Ireland 🇮🇪

We started the trip off by exploring Ireland for several days. Our first stop was to meet Michelle, Ian, and Steve in Dublin. The greater Caragol family flew from Denver ➡️ Dublin, and Leah and I flew from London ➡️ Dublin.

We started off our travels in Dublin by walking for *many* miles up and down the canal. We got some very tasty food, checked out a museum, and then walked through a district with a bunch of vibrant pubs.

The next day, we checked out an old church and walked over to the Guinness factory. It was like a mini Disney land for stout lovers. We learned all about the history of Guinness and more about beer than we expected. We got to finish the tour with a pint of Guinness, which was delicious.

### Malahide, Ireland 🇮🇪

After checking out Dublin, we hopped on a train and headed to the coastal town of Malahide. We stayed in a really nice hotel right on the water. The hotel was practically a maze of hallways and staircases. If there was a fire, we would have been 100% doomed.

Malahide had a super unique model train museum and we had a great time exploring it. I was personally very entertained with all the little yellow chicks that were hidden throughout the museum (it was close to Easter and I'm easily amused 🐥).

Our next day in Malahide, we visited the Malahide Castle on a tour, and the castle grounds. The castle was built in the 12th century and was a home to the Talbot family for over 800 years. The castle was very well preserved and had a lot of interesting history. There was also a butterfly garden on the grounds which was a nice suprise 🦋.

After checking out the castle, we picked up our bags from the hotel, and headed to the airport to catch a train to Belfast. It was fairly chaotic to catch our bus... First, it was difficult to find the correct bus stop. Once we found the right bus, we discovered it was full but there was another bus on the complete opposite side of the station that was leaving in about 5 minutes. We ran to the other bus to discover it only took cash and was leaving in about "30 seconds". Ian sprinted for an ATM, got cash, and we managed to snag a seat on the bus. [Budapest vibes?](https://europe.birki.io/posts/budapest/) I think so.

### Belfast, Northern Ireland 🇬🇧
