## Paris

The whole reason for this trip to Paris was to see a musician that I have seen a few times before. His name is Apashe and I wrote about going to one of his show's in a [previous blog post](/posts/apashe). When I was in [London](/posts/london-and-norway) a few months ago, Apashe announced that he would be playing a show in Paris but this time it would be at the [Bataclan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataclan_(theatre)) theatre and with a full brass ensemble. I had to go!

### Friday

On Friday, Leah and I hoped on a train from London to Paris 🚆.

This train went underneath the English Channel and was only about 2 hours long. We arrived in Paris and took the metro to our AirBnb. On our way up to our AirBnb we had to wait for an elevator that was about the width of my shoulders which was quite comical. While waiting, we noticed a mirror and Leah decided that we needed to take a dancing video every time we were waiting for the elevator to arrive 💃.

After getting all checked in to our AirBnb, we headed up the street to the Bataclan and got into quite the line for Apashe. I guess if you are an electronic artist *but* you blend it with **classical** music, the French show up in droves.

Apashe with a full brass ensemble was majestic 🎺.

The audience for Apashe was... **wild**. It was a constant mosh pit of dancing, jumping, and partying. It was a totally different scene from when I saw him the last two times in the US. I was honestly amazing that the crowd managed to have such high energy and then *maintain* it for the entire show. After being up front for only 45 minutes we had to get water and sit down (we felt old haha).

Once Apashe was over, we started to head back to our AirBnb but it was still pretty early so we popped into a restaurant on a street corner for some dessert. We had a glass of wine and some really tasty creme brûlée 🍷.

### Saturday

The first time we went to Paris (on our Europe trip) in 2017, we tried are best to "max out" every single day. We did a lot of sight seeing on that trip and were on a super strict budget. This time around, we wanted to bit a more relaxed and just enjoy the city of Paris.

We started out our day by walking over to a small cafe for some coffee to awaken our brains after the concert the night before. I got some sort of savory pancake and it was *amazing* 🤯

After breakfast, we took the metro over the *Musée d'Orsay* which is a museum that houses a lot of impressionist art. We figured we needed to see some art while we were in Paris 🎨.

Museums tend to make Leah and I extremely tired so afterwards, we went to obtain more caffeine at another cafe (and cookies). At the cafe, we met two other US students who were studying abroad in Florence and visiting Paris for the weekend. We chatted with them for over an hour about traveling and they asked for all sorts of advice on places we had been.

After our coffee break, we headed back to our AirBnb on the funky Paris metro.

Before we set out for our day, my coworker Eléonore (who lives in France), mentioned that there were a lot of protests today in Paris. These protests were in response to France raising the retirement age from 62 to 64. The protest was supposed to take place directly on the street we were staying at...

As we got closer to our street, we saw a lot of sirens and an odd burning smell. When we got onto our street, it was pretty empty and cleared out. There were a lot of small fires in the middle of the road and most of the trash bins had been set on fire. Right in front of our door, there was a car that was flipped over and set on fire. It was pretty wild and the French sure do know how to throw a good protest 🧨.

We talked with several people about the protests and they all seemed rather surprised it got as crazy as it did. Apparently there have frequently been other larger protests in Paris but they did not expect this one to get so out of hand. The general sentiment that we got from folks was that they were disappointed in the vandalism but they agreed with the cause of the protests.

After touring the brief chaos of our street, we changed and headed out to grab some food at a super tasty Egyptian restaurant called [Le Karnak](https://goo.gl/maps/NrExqPoJ6KTojZ836). The food was amazing and it was run by what appeared to be a boyfriend and girlfriend from Egypt; and we were the only people in the restaurant.

Once we finished eating, we hopped on the metro to head toward central Paris to go to a cocktail bar called [Little Red Door](https://goo.gl/maps/2DED8oPqo7B4742WA). The line was super long when we got there so we googled it and found out it had received a lot of awards and was recently voted top 50 bars in the world. Now I haven't really tried all that many cocktails and this was the first "cocktail bar" I had ever really been too but I was pretty impressed. The drinks were probably the best I had ever had in my life. All the drinks are made with ingredients that are grown in local gardens from sustainable farmers in France. We had the *rhubarb*, *raspberry*, and *olive* drinks. It was expensive but absolutely worth it 🍸.
