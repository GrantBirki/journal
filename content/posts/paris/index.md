## Paris

The whole reason for this trip to Paris was to see a musician that I have seen a few times before. His name is Apashe and I wrote about going to one of his show's in a [previous blog post](/posts/apashe). When I was in [London](/posts/london-and-norway) a few months ago, Apashe announced that he would be playing a show in Paris but this time it would be at the [Bataclan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bataclan_(theatre)) theatre and with a full brass ensemble. I had to go!

### Friday

On Friday, Leah and I hoped on a train from London to Paris üöÜ.

This train went underneath the English Channel and was only about 2 hours long. We arrived in Paris and took the metro to our AirBnb. On our way up to our AirBnb we had to wait for an elevator that was about the width of my shoulders which was quite comical. While waiting, we noticed a mirror and Leah decided that we needed to take a dancing video every time we were waiting for the elevator to arrive üíÉ.

After getting all checked in to our AirBnb, we headed up the street to the Bataclan and got into quite the line for Apashe. I guess if you are an electronic artist *but* you blend it with **classical** music, the French show up in droves.

Apashe with a full brass ensemble was majestic üé∫.

The audience for Apashe was... **wild**. It was a constant mosh pit of dancing, jumping, and partying. It was a totally different scene from when I saw him the last two times in the US. I was honestly amazing that the crowd managed to have such high energy and then *maintain* it for the entire show. After being up front for only 45 minutes we had to get water and sit down (we felt old haha).

Once Apashe was over, we started to head back to our AirBnb but it was still pretty early so we popped into a restaurant on a street corner for some dessert. We had a glass of wine and some really tasty creme br√ªl√©e üç∑.
