## December 2022

December 2022 was a really great month that was just absolutely packed with good times.

### Reaper ðŸ¤˜

The month started off with Reaper at the Church. We started off in the "riddim room" and then proceeded to wreck our bodies to Drum and Bass for hours on end.

Soon after Leah got there, we flew out to Arizona to see my brother Brooks graduate from GCU. Leah surprised Brooks and he had no idea she was coming to visit!

### Decadence ðŸŽµ

To close out December and the year of 2022, all of my friends went to Decadence NYE in Denver, CO. It is a two day EDM show and it was an absolute blast.
