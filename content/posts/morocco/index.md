## Intro

In the past, Leah has done a **lot** of planning for our trips. During Leah's first semester at King's College London, I had planned a trip on my first visit to [London and Norway](/posts/london-and-norway). The majority of the trip to Norway was a surprise and it was a huge success!

Before my next trip out to London, I started planning another "surprise trip" for Leah and I to go on, and this time we were heading to Morocco! üá≤üá¶

However, the trip did not remain a full surprise for long as I'm terrible at keeping secrets and Leah is a sneaky detective. While we were in [Paris](/posts/paris) (just a week before the trip) waiting for the Metro, there was a massive "Visit Morocco" poster on the wall. Leah just looked at the poster and went *"hmmmm"*. I'm pretty sure my laugh gave it all away.

## Marrakech

### Friday 2/17

We woke up early to pack for our "surprise trip", although at this point Leah was about 98.5% sure we were going to Morocco. This kind of helped though because she was looked at the weather there and that was helping her along with packing.

We took the train from London to Gatwick Airport and then took off to Marrakech.
