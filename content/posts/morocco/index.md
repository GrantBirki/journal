## Intro

In the past, Leah has done a **lot** of planning for our trips. During Leah's first semester at King's College London, I had planned a trip on my first visit to [London and Norway](/posts/london-and-norway). The majority of the trip to Norway was a surprise and it was a huge success!

Before my next trip out to London, I started planning another "surprise trip" for Leah and I to go on, and this time we were heading to Morocco! 🇲🇦

However, the trip did not remain a full surprise for long as I'm terrible at keeping secrets and Leah is a sneaky detective. While we were in [Paris](/posts/paris) (just a week before the trip) waiting for the Metro, there was a massive "Visit Morocco" poster on the wall. Leah just looked at the poster and went *"hmmmm"*. I'm pretty sure my laugh gave it all away.

## Marrakech

### Friday 2/17

We woke up early to pack for our "surprise trip", although at this point Leah was about 98.5% sure we were going to Morocco. This kind of helped though because she was looked at the weather there and that was helping her along with packing.

We took the train from London to Gatwick Airport and then took off to Marrakech.

✈️

When we arrived in Marrakech it was pretty late so we just took a taxi to our AirBnb, got some food at a nearby restaurant, and then went to bed.

### Saturday 2/18

Saturday was another early morning that started with travel. Our AirBnb was intentionally right across the street from the main train station in Marrakech since I had booked us train tickets to Casablanca. Last night at dinner, Leah keep guessing where we were going and Casablanca was not a single one of her guesses so she was completely surprised when we got on the train.

> I managed to get at least one surprise right at last! 😂

We managed to get off at the wrong train station coming into Casablanca and this was honestly foreshadowing for our time in Casablanca. We managed to get back on the train just before it left after we looked at our phones and realized we were in the wrong place. After getting back on the train, I had realized that I had rolled my suitcase through an enormous pile of wet poop (all over my shoes as well... delightful).

Soon we had arrived in Casablanca (at the correct stop) and made our way out of a train station. As Leah laughed, I rolled my luggage through a sprinkler outside.

We took a taxi to our AirBnb and then went into a nearby cafe while we waited for the cleaner to finish so we could drop off our bags.

Casablanca was **chaotic**... 😬

There were so many people, the cars all drove like they were on a death wish, and the streets were an absolute disaster.

This was my very first time in any part of Africa and it was honestly so overwhelming and rather stressful.

After finishing our Moroccan mint tea, dropped off our luggage, and set off on a stroll to the nearest "medina" (old city / market).

While planning this trip I had done some research around medinas and had a wildly different vision in my head. Online you see photos of these vibrant medinas with fine tile work, beautiful arches, and shops full of color spices. The reality was a bit different...

The medina we visited was full of shops containing knock-off Nike shoes, fake luxury bags, and shampoo. We went into one shop that looked like it had spices but the most interesting thing we found was what we believed to be "prostate stimulating powder".

We prompted left the medina and began to walk back to our AirBnb to asses the current situation that was Morocco.

#### Trip Adjustment

> A brief note about our trip adjustments back at our AirBnb

We had been in Morocco for about 16 hours at this point and realized we were in a bit over our heads. Leah was anxious, I was borderline having a break down, and everything around us felt like chaos. So we had a quick chat and I decided to tell Leah all the details about the trip we had planned. It wasn't exactly as she had imagined and all of Morocco so far was not at all how I imagined it. So we planned together to find a place our of the chaos this afternoon and also look at the schedule for the rest of our trip later that night.

After our "trip adjustment pow-wow", we headed over to the "fancy" area of Casablanca to get some food and escape from the chaos of the inner city. Our first stop was the beach to check out the Atlantic ocean. Getting close up to the water it was rather nice to look out and just hear the waves wash out the sound of the city. On our way back to the main road, we encountered a pretty angry dog chained to a broken railing. The dog saw us, started barking, and leap towards Leah and I. We both saw that it pulled right away from the fence and both the dog and the broken piece of chained fence started coming towards us. We both turned around and went full sprint down the steps. A bunch of locals laughed at us but we didn't find the dogs teeth too comical in the moment.

We tried another set of steps that didn't have any angry dogs and found ourselves in front of a "Four Seasons" hotel. We figured *why not* and basically snuck into the Four Seasons and sat down in the restaurant. We took one look at the menu and promptly left when we saw the prices 😂.

We walked down the street a bit and ended up in a fairly nice restaurant and got some pasta, a smoothie, and a nice pizza. After our dinner, we found one of the few places in the city that served alcohol nearby and went for a few drinks to ease our nerves from the chaotic day.

Overall, our sentiment on Casablanca was that it was a bit of a mess and not a place one should go if you're looking to relax or see sights.

> I am writing this section as we are sitting in the AirBnb after the day in Casablanca and we are both very excited to be leaving tomorrow evening 🙃.

### Sunday 2/19

On Sunday we slept in until 10am. We were both really not looking forward to getting up and having to leave the comfort of our AirBnb. Casablanca was just so chaotic and it didn't feel like there was much to do. We would also be checking out and would have to carry around all our bags for the day.

The night before, we had done some research and discovered that the best thing to do in Casablanca was to visit the **Hassan II** mosque of Casablanca. So we set out with all of our packs to the mosque via taxi.

We booked a tour for noon and then popped into a cafe to fuel up on coffee and pancakes before heading back for our tour.

To our knowledge, this is one of the few mosques you can actually tour in Morocco as a non-muslim since they are usually quite strict on who can enter and you must have a tour.

The mosque tour actually helped put us back on track with traveling as we really enjoyed it. While it wasn't "historic" in terms of age (constructed in 1993) it was extremely impressive by its design. The entire building was garnished in very intricate Islamic carvings. You could stare into many of the designs and be mesmerized.

The mosque was really quite beautiful and we both thought it helped turn our rough stay in Casablanca back around!

After the mosque we pretty much just hung out, got some food, read books, and then caught our train back to Marrakech 🚋. We booked a traditional riad for the night and were very excited to see what it's all about!
